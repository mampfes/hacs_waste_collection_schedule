## How to get the source arguments

Search for your collection schedule on the address on the [Mid-Sussex District Council](https://www.midsussex.gov.uk/waste-recycling/bin-collection/) site to see how they format your address. Preferred approach is to copy the address as displayed. If that doesn't work, the individual components can be supplied. General rule seems to be `HOUSE_NAME, HOUSE_NUMBER, STREET, POSTCODE` but it can vary for multi-occupancy buildings, house names where there are no numbers, house names where there are also house numbers, etc, so you may need to adjust which parts of the address are used for each argument.
