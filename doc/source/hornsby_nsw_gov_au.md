# Hornsby Shire Council

Support for schedules published via PDF by [Hornsby Shire Council](https://www.hornsby.nsw.gov.au/property/waste-and-recycling/your-weekly-collection/find-your-collection-dates).
Note that because information is embebdded in PDFs, but uses a pattern, the actual source connects and pulls data from a third party API.

## Configuration via configuration.yaml

```yaml
waste_collection_schedule:
  sources:
    - name: hornsby_nsw_gov_au
      args:
        property_id: 123456
```

### Configuration Variables

**property_id**

```yaml
waste_collection_schedule:
  sources:
    - name: hornsby_nsw_gov_au

```
